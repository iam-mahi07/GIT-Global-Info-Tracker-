Hey! Welcome to the world of GITðŸ‘‹

This repo helps you to gain a beginner level knowledge on Git. I promise!

You'd learn what actually git is, git branching strategies, and, many commands with a practical demonstration. 

NOTE: This repo is still work in progres, more information on different concepts yet to be added and I'm open to any suggestions/corrections if there are any.

Many thanks for visiting!
